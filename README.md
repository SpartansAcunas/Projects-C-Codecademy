## Projects C Codecademy

This repository contains the projects I completed during my personal training in the C programming language on Codecademy.

In total, I completed 8 projects in this language. However, if there are fewer projects in the repository, it's because I no longer have access to the platform where I was working on these projects.

Each project was related to a specific topic. The projects I completed include:

1. **Grocery Store (Variables)**
2. **Grocery Store 2 (Operators)**
3. **Dates and Switches (Conditionals)**
4. **Fizz Buzz (Loops and Errors)**
5. **Anagram Finder (Arrays and Strings)**
6. **String Copier (Pointers and Memory)**
7. **MiniCalendar (Functions)**
8. **Race Simulator (Structures)**
